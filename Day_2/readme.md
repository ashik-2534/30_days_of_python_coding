# 30 Days of Python Coding
==========================

This repository contains code snippets and examples from a 30-day Python coding.

## Day 2: Variables and Built in Function
--------------------------------------

### Variables

This file demonstrates the use of variables in Python, including:

* Valid names for declaring variables
* Assigning values to variables
* Multiple assignment

### Built-in Functions

This file uses the following built-in Python functions:

* `type()`: to check the data type of a variable
* `len()`: to get the length of a string

### Arithmetic Operations

This file demonstrates various arithmetic operations using variables, including:

* Addition: `num_one + num_two`
* Subtraction: `num_one - num_two`
* Multiplication: `num_one * num_two`
* Division: `num_one / num_two`
* Modulus/Remainder: `num_one % num_two`
* Exponentiation: `num_one ** num_two`
* Floor Division: `num_one // num_two`

### User Input

This file uses the `input()` function to get user input for various variables, including:

* First name
* Last name
* Country
* Age

### Calculations

This file performs calculations using variables, including:

* Calculating the area of a circle given the radius
* Calculating the circumference of a circle given the radius

### Example Use Cases

This file provides example use cases for the concepts demonstrated, including:

* Printing the data type of a variable
* Printing the length of a string
* Performing arithmetic operations using variables
* Getting user input for variables
* Performing calculations using variables

### Code Structure

This file is structured into the following sections:

* Variables
* Built-in Functions
* Arithmetic Operations
* User Input
* Calculations
* Example Use Cases

### Additional Examples

This file also includes the following additional examples:

* Declaring and using multiple variables
* Performing arithmetic operations with user input
* Calculating the area and circumference of a circle with user input

## Running the Code

To run this code, simply execute the `Helloworld.py` file using Python (e.g., `python Helloworld.py`).
