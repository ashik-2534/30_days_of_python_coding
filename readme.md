## Interactive Code Snippets
---------------------------

## Day 1: Basic Operations and Data Types
[click to open folder](./Day_1/)

This file (`Helloworld.py`) covers basic arithmetic operations and data types in Python.

### Arithmetic Operations

* Addition: `2 + 3`
* Subtraction: `3 - 1`
* Multiplication: `2 * 3`
* Division: `3 / 2`
* Exponentiation: `3 ** 2`
* Modulus/Remainder: `3 % 2`
* Floor Division: `3 // 2`

### Data Types

* Integer: `10`
* Float: `3.14`
* Complex Number: `1 + 3j`
* String: `"HelloWorld"`
* List: `[1, 2, 3]`
* Tuple: `(1, 2, 3)`
* Dictionary: `{"name": "John", "age": 36, "country": "Norway"}`
* Set: `{1, 2, 3}`
* Boolean: `True`

## Running the Code

To run this code, simply execute the `Helloworld.py` file using Python (e.g., `python Helloworld.py`).


## Day 2: Variables, Builtin Functions
--------------------------------------
[click to open folder](./Day_2/)

### Variables

This file demonstrates the use of variables in Python, including:

* Valid names for declaring variables
* Assigning values to variables
* Multiple assignment

### Built-in Functions

This file uses the following built-in Python functions:

* `type()`: to check the data type of a variable
* `len()`: to get the length of a string

### Arithmetic Operations

This file demonstrates various arithmetic operations using variables, including:

* Addition: `num_one + num_two`
* Subtraction: `num_one - num_two`
* Multiplication: `num_one * num_two`
* Division: `num_one / num_two`
* Modulus/Remainder: `num_one % num_two`
* Exponentiation: `num_one ** num_two`
* Floor Division: `num_one // num_two`

### User Input

This file uses the `input()` function to get user input for various variables, including:

* First name
* Last name
* Country
* Age

This file performs calculations using variables, including:

* Calculating the area of a circle given the radius
* Calculating the circumference of a circle given the radius

### Example Use Cases

This file provides example use cases for the concepts demonstrated, including:

* Printing the data type of a variable
* Printing the length of a string
